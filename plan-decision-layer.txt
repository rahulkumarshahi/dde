1. Look into stocks, index (then options) data for volume and price (3 months ahead)
2. Filter on events based calendar (hints from Barrons)
3. Create blocks


1. Get data stream:
    get_data_price(ticker_id, date_st, date_end, freq)
    get_data_volume(ticker_id, date_st, date_end, freq)
    
    returns
    data in tabular (panda dataframe) etc.  
    
2. Apply Level-1 filters
   a. SMA-10 filters
   b. SMA-30 filters
   c. RSI filters
   d. Momentum filters
   
3. Apply Level-2 filters
   a. Barrons recommendation (RSI feeds)
   b. Semantic based recommendation (Noise space)
   c. Economic clalendar feed
   d. Events calendar feed

4. Apply Level-3 filters
    a. GDP data
    b. IMF data
    c. Cross-border trade data
    d. Political environment data
    
Each of the filters have a small python snippet which have the format as :
For example in Level-1 SMA-10 filter, e.g.: 
  def lvl1_sma_10(data):
          return {tabular data}

  More on this later...
